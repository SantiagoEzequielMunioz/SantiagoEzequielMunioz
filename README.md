Hi, im Santiago Mu√±oz and I've been learning some python coding for about 6 months on my own, and recently some git/github.
My first project was a personal calculator for a friend and his ecommerce, which I "sold to him" for a brand wine (no idea about the $ market so it was a gentleman's deal).
Despite the horrendous spaghetti code, i learnt a lot. Willing to continue learning !!
